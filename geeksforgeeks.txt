             are the backbone of organized and efficient code in Python. Here, in this section of Python 3 tutorial we'll explore their syntax, parameter handling, return values and variable scope. From basic concepts to advanced techniques like closures and decorators. Along the way, we'll also introduce versatile functions like range(), map, filter and lambda functions.
